# Treehouse Python Techdegree Project #02
-----------------------------------------
- This program's purpose is to take a list of soccer players and organize them into three teams with each team including equally experienced players.  
- First the program reads a given csv file with the player's information and converts that info into a list to be iterated. 
- Based on the condition of having previous soccer experience or not, three players from each category of experience are split into the three teams (Sharks, Raptors, Dragons).
- The program outputs a new .txt file that lists the soccer teams and their players along with whether or not they have experience and their guardian(s) name(s).
- Upon the program running, another file is created for each player's Guardian(s) that welcomes them to league and shares the time and location of their first practice.
